Coscup is an annual conference held by Taiwan open source communities. This year, I participated in Coscup as a speaker and gave the talk about how I contribute golang OSS.  It’s a really good experience to give a talk at Coscup. Not only it’s a biggest open source feast in Taiwan but also you can learn and see a lot of passionate people in this conference. Although recent years you can hear a large amount of questions like What FOSS stands for? Some people consider different groups treat OSS from different purposes. More and more companies and people join and contribute OSS but some of them are for business reasons and some of them just want to gain more reputations. However, I still believe most of us just want to share good things with others. It’s also the reason why I like to join the communities.

Unlike last year, I gave a quite technical topic regarding CNCF project called Thanos. This year I tried to talk about how I participated in golang OSS project called [YouTube](https://github.com/kkdai/youtube). One of most interesting thing is that at the end of my talk a lot of people come to ask me more details about this project. Things like how to create a PR properly, how to join an OSS without writing code. This makes me feel good because I potentially help some people get involved in contributing something.
